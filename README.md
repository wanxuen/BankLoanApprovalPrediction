# BankLoanApprovalPrediction
The datasets related to bank loan approval revealed a substantial dataset, comprising 255,327 observations in the 'BankLoanApproval.csv' file. By relating the 20 new applicants in the ‘NewApplicants.csv’ file, we are tasked with identifying whether the loan applications should be approved or should be rejected. In order to predict the new outcomes, Python, involving scikitlearn, was utilised as a toolkit to explore, preprocess, and analyse the ‘BankLoanApproval.csv’ dataset. Moreover, to conduct thorough data mining, the stages of a comprehensive machine learning project are invaluable. It involves preparation, development, and evaluation. In simpler terms, the data mining process begins with data collection and preparation. Next, a model is selected and trained, followed by model evaluation. Finally, hyperparameters are tuned and predictive models are generated.

After predicting all the models involving classification, a confusion matrix is used to compute the performance measures. Generally, confusion matrix is a table visualising and 
summarising the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted and actual labels. By reviewing all the calculated confusion matrices, the best predictive model can be determined.
